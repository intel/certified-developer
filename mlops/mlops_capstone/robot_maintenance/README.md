## Robotics Predictive Maintenance Lifecycle Solution Component
The demand predictive asset maintenance component uses an XGBoost classifier to flag assets that need maintenance.  It leverages the Intel® Extension for Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, and daal4py on Intel® 4th Generation Xeon® Scalable processors.

## Technology Stack

This component is a comprehensive solution that utilizes the power of Intel Xeon Scalable Processors on the Intel Developer Cloud. It includes a set of convenient scripts to facilitate the seamless deployment of the application on 4th Generation Xeon VMs. To enhance the efficiency of data processing and inference in the machine learning pipeline, we leverage the daal4py library and Intel scikit-learn extensions from the AI analytics toolkit. To kickstart the development process, we incorporate the "Predictive Asset Health Analytics" AI Reference Kit. For streamlined deployment, we employ FastAPI to build API endpoints and Docker to containerize our applications, ensuring ease of deployment and management within the DevOps framework.
