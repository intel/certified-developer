    "# Introduction\n",
    "Welcome to this Jupyter notebook dedicated to understanding the core concepts of MLOps using MLflow!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective\n",
    "In the rapidly evolving world of Machine Learning (ML), it's vital to maintain a systematic approach to model development, deployment, and monitoring. This approach is commonly referred to as MLOps. Our primary aim is to delve deep into some of its pivotal components, such as model experiment tracking and model registries.\n",
    "\n",
    "What Will We Cover?\n",
    "1. **MLOps Overview**: A brief on why MLOps is critical and its primary components.\n",
    "2. **Experiment Tracking with MLflow**: We'll train two distinct models and demonstrate how to log their parameters, metrics, and details for reproducibility and comparison.\n",
    "3. **Model Registries**: How to register models, differentiate between stages (like Production and Staging), and manage various versions of models.\n",
    "4. **Inference**: Using registered models to make predictions, distinguishing between models in different stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why MLflow?\n",
    "MLflow is a versatile open-source platform that streamlines machine learning lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, and deployment. It's known for its simplicity and integrative approach, making it an ideal tool for both beginners and seasoned ML professionals.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll have a hands-on understanding of how MLflow facilitates MLOps and why it's an essential tool in today's ML toolkit."

    "3. We trained two models and logged their runs with MLflow, tagging them appropriately.\n",
    "4. We registered our models in different stages: production and staging. This helps in differentiating models ready for live environments vs those still under evaluation.\n",
    "5. Lastly, we used our registered models for inference, showcasing how easy it is to fetch and use models from a centralized repository."
